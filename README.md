# Limitations of my bot

I don't have unlimited servers and bandwidth, so I have to make some restrictions.

* 10 GiB one-way traffic per 24 hours for each user
* maximum 5 minutes streaming conversion support
* maximum 3 subscriptions

You can choose to become 'VIP' if you really need large traffic. And also, you could always deploy your own bot.

# Features

1. fast download and upload.
2. ads free
3. support progress bar
4. audio conversion
5. playlist support
6. VIP support
7. support different video resolutions
8. support sending as file or streaming as video
9. supports celery worker distribution - faster than before.
10. subscriptions to YouTube Channels
11. cache mechanism - download once for the same video.
